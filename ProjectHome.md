### Useful Tools ###
[GObject Builder](http://www.jirka.org/gob.html)   [Download](http://code.google.com/p/static-gtk2-mingw32/downloads/detail?name=GObject_Builder.zip)

> GOB (GOB2 anyway) is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code so that generated files are not edited. Syntax is inspired by Java and Yacc or Lex. The implementation is intentionally kept simple, and no C actual code parsing is done.
